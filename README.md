# mkds-tag
Tag game mode for Mario Kart DS that replaces Shine Runners.

## Building
To build, use Szymbar's fork of New Super Mario Bros. Editor 5. Create a folder containing the files from this repository and an EUR Mario Kart DS ROM. Open the ROM in New Super Mario Bros. Editor, open the Tools/Options tab, then click Run Make+Insert. The first time you run this it may prompt an error, in which case just click continue. Run Make+Insert again and it should no longer error. Finally, close out of New Super Mario Bros. Editor and the ROM should now be patched with the code. 

## Operation
The Tag gamemode replaces the previous Shine Runners gamemode. It retains many of the aspects of a game of Shine Runners, however. Shines will spawn throughout the stage as normal, however the goal of the game does not involve collecting the most shines. Instead, the more shines you have, the less likely you are to be It on the next cycle. Each cycle, a random player is chosen to be It based on the number of shines of the participants. Every cycle, the person currently It is eliminated and a new random player is chosen.
